    <h2>On 13th of May, the development of our website was started. </h2>
    <h2>Everything was going just fine, we hosted our website and it was up on the web for everyone to see.</h2>
    <h2>Until, about a day later, our hosting account got suspended for abuse.</h2>
    <h2>We had to move our site to GitHub Pages, and that's where it is located now.</h2>
